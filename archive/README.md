# Archived Installers

These installers are deprecated. Please use `FEDERATED-INSTALLER-UNIFIED.py` in the main directory.

## Archived Files

- `FEDERATED-INSTALLER-UNIFIED-VERBOSE.py` - Verbose installer with detailed output (deprecated)
- Other legacy installers moved here for historical reference

## Why Archived?

These installers had various issues that have been resolved in the main UNIFIED installer:
- Incorrect Python MCP import patterns
- GitHub-based approach that was less reliable than bundled sources
- Verbose output that was unnecessary for most users

## Current Solution

Use the main installer: `python FEDERATED-INSTALLER-UNIFIED.py`

This achieves 15/15 MCP success rate (100%).
