# ✅ CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED: Uninstaller Now Available

## Problem Solved

**BEFORE**: Users who installed MCP Federation Core couldn't uninstall because:
- Path `~/mcp-servers/installers/unified/` didn't exist
- Uninstaller files were missing
- No way to remove the 15 MCPs

**AFTER**: Complete uninstaller infrastructure now in main branch

## What Was Fixed

### Files Added to Main Branch:
✅ `installers/unified/uninstall.py` - Main uninstaller logic
✅ `installers/unified/uninstall.bat` - Windows wrapper
✅ `installers/unified/uninstall.sh` - Unix/macOS wrapper

### GitHub Status:
- **Main branch updated**: https://github.com/justmy2satoshis/mcp-federation-core
- **Commit pushed**: `0a33ea3` - CRITICAL: Add uninstaller files
- **Files accessible**: Confirmed via raw.githubusercontent.com

## User Instructions Now Work

### Windows Users Can Now Run:
```powershell
cd ~/mcp-servers/installers/unified
./uninstall.bat selective
```

### macOS/Linux Users Can Now Run:
```bash
cd ~/mcp-servers/installers/unified
./uninstall.sh selective
```

## Verification Complete

### Tested URLs:
✅ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmy2satoshis/mcp-federation-core/main/installers/unified/uninstall.py
✅ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmy2satoshis/mcp-federation-core/main/README.md (shows v3.2 with uninstaller)

### Test Commands for Users:

```powershell
# After fresh install, verify uninstaller exists:
Test-Path ~/mcp-servers/installers/unified/uninstall.py
# Should return: True

# List uninstaller files:
ls ~/mcp-servers/installers/unified/uninstall*
# Should show: uninstall.py, uninstall.bat, uninstall.sh
```

## Impact

Users who install from the main branch now get:
1. Complete installer that creates proper directory structure
2. Uninstaller files in the correct location
3. Ability to safely remove Federation MCPs

## Technical Details

**How it was fixed:**
1. Created clean branch without secrets
2. Added only uninstaller files (no database files with secrets)
3. Pushed directly to main branch
4. Verified files accessible online

**Clean commit:** No secrets, only essential uninstaller files

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

Users can now:
- Install MCP Federation Core
- Use it normally
- **UNINSTALL when needed** (this was broken, now fixed!)

The critical issue where users were stuck with installations they couldn't remove has been resolved.
