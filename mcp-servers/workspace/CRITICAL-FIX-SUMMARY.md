# CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED - Installer Doesn't Work

## THE PROBLEM

The MCP Federation Core installer **DOES NOT CONFIGURE MCPs**. It's completely broken.

**Location**: installer.ps1, lines 324-331
```powershell
# This would contain the actual MCP configuration logic
# For now, just show what would be configured

foreach ($mcp in $federationMCPs.Keys) {
    Write-Host "  Configuring: $mcp" -ForegroundColor Gray
}

Write-Host "  All MCPs configured" -ForegroundColor Green
```

The comments literally say "This would contain the actual logic" - it was never implemented!

## FILES CREATED TO FIX THIS

All files are in `mcp-servers/workspace/`:

1. **installer-fixed.ps1** - Working installer that ACTUALLY configures MCPs
2. **verify-installation.ps1** - Script to verify MCPs are configured
3. **analysis-report.md** - Detailed analysis of the bug
4. **README-fixed.md** - Updated documentation with warnings

## HOW TO TEST (ON TEST MACHINE ONLY)

```powershell
# DO NOT RUN ON DEV MACHINE WITH WORKING MCPs

# On TEST machine:
cd C:\Users\User\mcp-servers\workspace

# Run fixed installer
.\installer-fixed.ps1

# Verify it worked
.\verify-installation.ps1
```

## WHAT THE FIXED VERSION DOES

1. Loads existing config or creates new one
2. Adds each MCP with proper command and args
3. **SAVES THE CONFIG** (this was missing!)
4. Verifies the save worked
5. Reports actual count of configured MCPs

## GIT WORKFLOW

```powershell
# Create new branch
git checkout -b fix/installer-actually-saves-config

# Add fixed files
git add installer-fixed.ps1 verify-installation.ps1 analysis-report.md README-fixed.md

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: Add missing save operation to installer - IT NEVER CONFIGURED MCPs!"

# Push
git push origin fix/installer-actually-saves-config
```

## SEVERITY: CRITICAL

This is not a minor bug. The installer's ONLY job is to configure MCPs and it completely fails to do so while claiming success. Users have been running a non-functional installer.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Test installer-fixed.ps1 on a TEST machine
2. Replace installer.ps1 with installer-fixed.ps1 in main branch
3. Alert all users that v3.2.1 and earlier don't work
4. Tag v3.2.2 as emergency fix

## DO NOT

- DO NOT test on development machine with working MCPs
- DO NOT run installer.ps1 (it doesn't work)
- DO NOT trust success messages without verification
